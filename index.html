            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> From the start of the semester, the term 'repository' has been mentioned often in the Web Applications course. A repository is essentially what Github provides us with: a hosting service with ample features for storing the code one creates. Repositories can be interpreted as a vault, for it is where software packages are installed and held. With this being said, that is exactly what the purpose of repositories is: to allow individuals to get access to the software in an accessible and easy manner! It is also helpful in the sense that other individuals may have input to better the software system available to them in the repository, which can in turn create a wave of positive feedback from user to programmer or software developer. In essence, it is a place where databases are easily accessible and distributed amongst those who seek them in the world wide web.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System is what allows for multiple users to work, enhance, edit, and modify files at the same time. It is a repository for multiple files which solves the issue of working with individuals, since it is at the hands of every person interested. With version control system, it can be monitored who changes the files through revision history as well as the time it was changed. It also even allows you to compare the unedited version with the current, modified version in order to thoroughly analyze the changes! With that being said, you can also revert to the original version in case of that being needed, so files can technically never be in jeopardy of being overridden. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> GIT is another word that constantly comes up in the Web Applications Development course. With websites like GITHUB, a developer has the opportunity to utilize a free and open source. The advantages of using GIT (a distributed version control system) is the fact that whomever is utilizing the repository has their own copy of the data. It also prevents files from being overwritten as well as enhances the speed in which the program runs all while allowing you to choose from working online or offline. Sites like Cloud 9 connect to GIT, like GITHUB through GIT commands. This way, both servers are connected and this is done through the terminal on cloud 9. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The history of GIT can be traced down to its date of origin back in 2005. This occurred when the developers of Linux kernel gave up accessbility to a system known as source control  management, which was in turn used to utilize to withold the project. The creator of GIT said he wished to create a distributed system that he could utilize similarly to BitKeeper. When he created the first version, he described it as "the stupid content tracker." However, he passed his role to Junio Hamano, whom now still maintains the head position of GIT. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As explored, there are many ways in which GIT can be helpful and useful. With that also comes a diverse approach as to what one can use it for and how one can use it. You have your commands that can either be categorized under basic commands, or remote commands. If one intends on assisting another user on a GIT project, one has to properly manage their remote repositories.In order to expose your remote servers that have already been configured, one can utilize the "git remote" command. This is what this Web Applications Course usually designates as some of the primary steps when beginning a project. The instructions of opening up the terminal and "PUSHING" might ring a bell... right? </p>
